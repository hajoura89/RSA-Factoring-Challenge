Factorize as many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller numbers.
->Usage: factors <file>
->where <file> is a file containing natural numbers to factor.
->One number per line
->You can assume that all lines will be valid natural numbers greater than 1
->You can assume that there will be no empy line, and no space before and after the valid number
->The file will always end with a new line
->Output format: n=p*q
->one factorization per line
->p and q don’t have to be prime numbers
->You can work on the numbers of the file in the order of your choice
->Your program should run without any dependency: You will not be able to install anything on the machine we will run your program on
->Time limit: Your program will be killed after 5 seconds if it hasn’t finish
